    <h1>B.Y.O.B.</h1>
    <h3>System Of A Down</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        You!<br>
        <br>
        Why do they always send the poor?<br>
        <br>
        Barbarisms by Barbaras with pointed heels<br>
        Victorious Victoriaâ€™s kneel for brand new spanking deals<br>
        Marching forward, hypocritic and hypnotic computers<br>
        You depend on our protection, yet you feed us lies from the table cloth<br>
        <br>
        La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, ooh-ooh<br>
        Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time<br>
        Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine<br>
        <br>
        Kneeling roses disappearing into Moses' dry mouth<br>
        Breaking into Fort Knox, stealing our intentions<br>
        Hangars sitting dripped in oil, crying, "Freedom"<br>
        Handed to obsoletion, still, you feed us lies from the table cloth<br>
        <br>
        La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, ooh-ooh<br>
        Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time<br>
        Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine<br>
        Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time<br>
        Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine<br>
        <br>
        Blast off, it's party time<br>
        And we don't live in a fascist nation<br>
        Blast off, it's party time<br>
        And where the fuck are you?<br>
        <br>
        Where the fuck are you?<br>
        Where the fuck are you?<br>
        Why don't presidents fight the war?<br>
        Why do they always send the poor?<br>
        Why don't presidents fight the war?<br>
        Why do they always send the poor?<br>
        Why do they always send the poor?<br>
        Why do they always send the poor?<br>
        Why they always send the poor?<br>
        <br>
        Kneeling roses disappearing into Moses' dry mouth<br>
        Breaking into Fort Knox, stealing our intentions<br>
        Hangars sitting dripped in oil, crying, "Freedom"<br>
        Handed to obsoletion, still, you feed us lies from the table cloth<br>
        <br>
        La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, ooh-ooh<br>
        Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time<br>
        Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine<br>
        Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time<br>
        Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sun<br>
        <br>
        Where the fuck are you?<br>
        Where the fuck are you?<br>
        Why don't presidents fight the war?<br>
        Why do they always send the poor?<br>
        Why don't presidents fight the war?<br>
        Why do they always send the poor?<br>
        Why do they always send the poor?<br>
        Why do they always send the poor?<br>
        <br>
        Why do they always send the poor?<br>
        Why do they always send the poor?<br>
        Why do they always send the poor?<br>
        They always send the poor, they always send the poor<br>
